# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction 🧪

This project focuses on **predicting the quality of wine** using various supervised machine learning models based on chemical properties of wine samples.

---

## 🧠 Models Used

Multiple algorithms were applied and compared to find the best-performing model for wine quality prediction:

- 👨‍🔬 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- 🌳 **Decision Tree**
- 🌲 **Random Forest**
- ⚙️ **Other ML models** were also explored for performance evaluation

---

## 📊 Objective

The goal was to train models that can **predict wine quality scores** based on inputs like acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol level, and more.
